            <h3>Text</h3>
            <p>The course textbook is <u>Problem Solving and Program Design in C</u> by Hanly and Koffman.</p>
            <p>Prior editions and alternate textbooks are acceptable.</p>
         </div>

         <div class='info-block'>
            <h3>Activities</h3>
            <p><strong>Reading &mdash; </strong>The schedule outlines the order in which topics will be covered in lecture and the associated chapters/sections in the textbook that you should read. The lectures may not cover all of the material in the assigned reading, but such material may appear in labs, programming assignments, and exams.</p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>Class Participation &mdash; </strong>The lectures are for your benefit. You should ask questions when you have them. I am more than happy to answer any questions that you may have relating to the course material.</p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>Office Hours &mdash; </strong>Office hours are for your benefit. I am more than happy to answer any course related questions or to help with any programming issues you may have.</p>
            <p>Because my office availability is poor this quarter, feel free to also email me.</p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>Labs &mdash; </strong>There are currently ten planned lab assignments. Each lab assignment must be demonstrated in lab by the last lab of the week (unless an alternate date is specified). You are allowed and encouraged to work together on lab assignments.</p>
            <p>Once you have completed the lab assignment, you are encouraged to use the remaining lab time to work on your programming assignments.</p>
            <p>Labs are typically assigned on Monday and due by Wednesday Lab.</p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>Programming Assignments &mdash; </strong>There will be six programming assignments. These assignments are intended to be of greater length and complexity than the lab assignments.</p>
            <p>Programming assignments must be completed <strong>individually</strong>. Collaboration on programming assignments is not permitted.</p>
            <p>Assignments are typically assigned on Monday, and due at <strong>11:59pm</strong> the following Tuesday.</p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>Lab Exams &mdash; </strong>There will be three lab exams.</p>
            <p>They are closed book, closed notes, and closed neighbor.</p>
            <br />

            <p>
               <p><strong>Written Exams &mdash; </strong>There will be two midterm exams and one final exam. The exams will cover concepts presented in lecture and material based on the labs and programming assignments.</p>
               <p>The exams will be closed book and closed notes.</p>
            </p>

            <h3>Due Dates and Lateness</h3>
            <p>
               Programming assignments will be submitted electronically using handin.
               Except in the most extreme situations, late assignments will not be accepted.
               Even if you cannot complete an assignment, submit what you have for partial credit.
            </p>

            <p>
               At a minimum, programming assignments must compile to be considered for grading.
               If a submitted program does not compile, you will receive a zero for that assignment.
               You should always pay <strong>close attention</strong> to all submission instructions for an assignment.
               Any submission that breaks grading scripts due to not following directions will receive a penalty.
            </p>
         </div>

         <div class='info-block'>
            <h3>Missed Exams</h3>
            <p>
               Make-up or early exams will not be given except in the most extreme situations.
               If you must miss an exam due to extreme illness, etc., contact the instructor immediately.
            </p>
         </div>

         <div class='info-block'>
            <h3>Collaboration and Honor Code</h3>
            <p>For each assignment that you submit, the following statements must be true.</p>

            <ul>
               <li>You wrote each line of code in your submission (excluding any code that the instructor has explicitly allowed you to use).</li>
               <li>Your submission is not a duplication (in any part) of another student's submission.</li>
               <li>Your submission is not a copy (in any part) of a single solution developed as part of a collaborative effort.</li>
               <li>You did not copy code from another source (student or otherwise).</li>
               <li>You did not provide your code to another student.</li>
               <li>You are able to answer detailed questions about each part of your submission.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               If you do not agree to these rules, then you need to drop the course.
               Continued enrollment in the course is implicit agreement to adhere to these rules.
               Submissions will be compared using software that can reliably detect similarities among programs.

         <div class='info-block'>
            <h4>What is allowed?</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Help with proper syntax and compilation errors.</li>
               <li>Help finding (but not fixing) a bug, but only after a reasonable amount of time spent testing and debugging.
                  Do not accept help until you have tried to find the bug yourself; this is part of learning.
                  Using the wrong algorithm or incorrectly implementing the algorithm is not considered a bug in this sense.
               </li>
               <li>Discussion of general programming techniques.</li>
               <li>Discussion of algorithms and data structures required by the assignment description.</li>
            </ul>
