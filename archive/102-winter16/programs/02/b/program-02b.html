      <p style="margin-left: 21px;">You will
         be implementing a class that represents a simple list like, for
         instance, a list of numbers, a shopping list, or a todo list. Common
         things one does with a list include adding stuff, removing stuff,
         seeing if somthing is on a list. In programming lingo, a list is an
         example of an Abstract Data Type (ADT). An ADT is a data type whose
         logical operations are defined independently of the physical (concrete)
         implementation. As you know, a Java interface specfies method
         signatures but no method logic - an excellent choice for defining an
         ADT! You will implement the methods specified by the interface (plus a
         few more) using an array of Object references to support the list
         operations. Later in the quarter you will implement that same ADT a
         completely different physical implementation to experience, once again,
         how the logic associated with a methods can be achieved in different
         ways.<br>

               to <a href="docs/BasicArrayList.html">this specification</a>.
               This class is not
               a generic class like the Java Standard Library's ArrayList class.
               Instead, it will be <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">built upon a
               array of
               Object references</span>. Remember, due to polymorphism, a
               reference to
               any object of any type is also an <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">instanceof</span>
               Object. This means your BasicArrayList class can store a reference to
               any and all Java class types - even ones that have not even been
               written yet!

                  often addtional and necessary information there.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>Notice that this class in not generic.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>This class must be written using an array of Object
                  references
                  to store and retrieve values.
               </p>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">This
               class
               distinguishes</span> between the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">size</span>
               of the list
               and the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">capacity</span>
               of the list. The "size" of the list is the number of elements in
               the list (stuff added but not removed) at a specific point in time. The
               "capacity" of the list is the current length of the private array of
               Object references. For example, a newly consructed BasicArrayList has a
               size of zero and a capacity of ten. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">In Java you can use the
               <span style="text-decoration: underline;">.length</span> property</span>
               (not a method) on any array reference to find out is length/capacity at
               runtime - useful!
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>In the spirit of minimal necessary instance variables,
                  your
                  class is
                  limited to two instance variables, an <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object[] </span>to
                  hold references to the items added to the list and an <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">int</span> to keep
                  track of the number of items in the list (its size). Be sure you don't
                  confuse the size of a list with its capacity.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>Note that a list never has any gaps (holes) between the values
               in contains. This means all indexes between zero and size-1 contains
               things added (and not removed) from the list by the user of the list.
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>You must only allocate a new array when it is necessary to
                  grow or shrink the capacity of the array.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Recall
                  that arrays are fixed in size.</span> For any method that
                  increases the
                  size of the array (adds stuff) you must grow the private array, as and
                  when necessary, to support the operation. When attempting to add to an
                  array that is full you must make a new, larger array, copy all the old
                  arrays stuff into it, and add the new element. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">You must use
                  this
                  algorithm when growing the array</span> - the new larger array
                  must
                  always be exactly twice as large as the old (full) array.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Several
                  of the methods in this class throw exception when certain errors occur.
                  Be sure to read the detailed method descriptions to see which methods
                  and what specific exceptions. You will have to write the conditional
                  logic to determine when to throw the exceptions. Exceptions are Java
                  classes - just contstruct the type you want to throw and throw it. Here
                  is an example of how to throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException (don't
                  forget that you may need to import the exception if it is not in
                  java.lang):
