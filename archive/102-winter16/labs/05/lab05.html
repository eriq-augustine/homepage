      <span style="font-weight: bold;">CPE 102 Lab 5 -
      Inheritance</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Goals:</span><br>
      <ul>
         <li>To be able to write classes that take advantage of
            inheritance.
         </li>
         <li>To understand the mechanics and behaviors of classes
            written with Inheritance.
         </li>
         <li>To learn how to correctly override the equals method in most
            situations.
         </li>
         <li>To learn the vocabulary of Inheritance in general.</li>
         <li>To learn the specific&nbsp;tools of Inheritance in Java.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orientation:</span><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 26px;">You will write three classes
         that can make use of Inheritance, an Animal class, a Person class, and
         a Student class. There is a natural hierarchical relationship
         between these classes, especially when we think of sets. &nbsp;The
         Student class is the most specific class type as a Student is a Person
         and a Person is an Animal but not all Animals are Persons and not all
         Persons are Students. &nbsp;This lab explores how to represent such
         relationships in an Object Oriented way and how to take best advantage
         of the features of Inheritance when doing so.

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What To Do: </span><br>
      <ol>
         <li>Write a class called Animal that has a single private
            instance variable of type int that represents the number of legs the
            animal has. &nbsp;You should write a single constructor that takes
            an int parameter used to initialize the instance variable. Override the
            equals method (inherited from Object) so that it returns false if the
            reference passed in is null, or is not the same type as this, or
            doesn't have the same
            number of legs as this, otherwise true. Override the toString method
            inherited from Object so that it returns the message "I am an Animal
            object with N legs" where N is replaced with the actual number of legs
            the Animal object was constructed with.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Make sure your instance
            variable(s) are private and do not add any other methods.</span> Test
            your Animal
            class before moving on.
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Write a class called Person that extends Animal. Person
               should have a single private instance variable of type String that
               represents the name of the Person. Write a single consructor that takes
               a String parameter used to initialize the instance variable AND an int
               parameter representing the number of legs the person has. Use the
               super() syntax to call the contructor of the super class Animal.
               Override the equals
               method (inherited from Animal that inherited it from Object) so that it
               returns false if the reference passed in is null, or is not the same
               type as
               this, or doesn't have the same number of legs as this, or does not have
               the same name as
               this, otherwise true. Override the toString method inherited from
               Animal that inherited it from Object so that it returns "I am an Animal
               object with N legs and a Person object whose name is XXX", where N is
               replaced with the correct number of legs for the Animal and XXX with
               the correct
               name for the Person. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Make sure all instance
               variable(s) private and do not
               add any other methods.</span> Test your Person class before moving on.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>Write a class called Student that extends Person. Student
            should have a single private instance variable of type double that
            represents the GPA of the Student. Write a single constructor that
            takes a double parameter used to initialize the instance variable AND a
            String representing the student's name AND an int representing the
            number of legs the student has. Use the super() syntax to call the
            constructor of the super class Person. Override the equals
            method (inherited from Person that inherited it from Animal that
            inherited it from Object) so that it returns false if the reference
            passed in is null, or is not the same type as this, or doesn't have the
            same number of
            legs as this, or does not have the same name as this, or does not have
            the same gpa as this, otherwise
            true. &nbsp;Override the toString method inherited from Person that
            inherited it from Animal that inherited in from Object so that it
            returns&nbsp;"I am an Animal
            object with N legs and a Person object whose name is XXX and a Student
            Object with a Z.Z gpa", where N is
            replaced with the correct number of legs for the Animal and XXX with
            the correct
            name for the Person and Z.Z with the correct GPA for the Student (no
            special formatting of the GPA is required for this lab). <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Make sure all instance
            variable(s) private and do not
            add any other methods.</span> Test your Student class before moving on.
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Test
               and experiment with these classes until you feel you have a good sense
               of how inheritance works and what benefits it can provide.
               &nbsp;Discuss your views with your other students to see if your
               insights agree with theirs. Ask for assistance from your instructor to
               clarify any ambiguities or disagreements you encounter.
