            <h3>REQUIRED TEXTBOOK</h3>
            <p>Kenneth H. Rosen. <em>Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications</em>. (7th edition.)</p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <h3>CLASS STRUCTURE</h3>
            <p>Lecture will consist of covering course material as well as in-class activities. Questions about the reading, examples in the book, and homework are encouraged.</p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <h3>COURSEWORK</h3>
            <h4>Readings</h4>
            <p>There are assigned readings from the textbook. The readings are to be completed on the date shown on the calendar. Not all material in the reading will be covered in lecture but you are still responsible for knowing it for quizzes and exams. Come to class prepared with any questions from the reading that you would like addressed.</p>
            <br />

            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p>Each section will have several examples from the reading listed on the course schedule. It is expected that you look through these examples carefully, understand them completely, and be able to answer a similar (or identical) question on a quiz or exam. </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Homework</h4>
            <p>Homework problems from the text will be assigned nearly every lecture period. Homework will be collected at the beginning of class every Tuesday. I will only grade 2 or 3 or 4 problems, and assign a grade based on those problems and the overall completelness of the assignement. It is imperative that you complete and understand the homework problems that are assigned. On exams and quizzes, you WILL be given problems very similar to those that are assigned from the text. Working together on homework problems is encouraged; however, you are responsible for understanding and completing all problems.</p>
            <br />

            <h4>Quizzes</h4>
            <p>There may be weekly quizzes every Wednesday throughout the quarter, possibly with the exception of weeks with midterms. This will be shown on the schedule. Quizzes will be about 15 minutes in duration. Quizzes will contain problems that are either verbatim from the HW or very similar to HW problems, or examples from the text book. <strong>No makeup quizzes will be given.</strong> If you do better on the HW than on the quiz for any given week, your HW score may replace your quiz score.</p>
            <br />

            <h4>Midterms and Final Examination</h4>
            <p>There will be 2 midterm examinations and a comprehensive (cumulative) final examination. More information about exams will be given prior to the exams.</p>

            <p>Letter Grades are determined on a straight percentage basis, as follows:</p>
            <p> A 90% - 100%, B 80%-89%, C 70%-79%, D 60%-69%, F below 60%<br /></p>

         <h3>ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES</h3>

         <h4>DEADLINES</h4>
         <p>Missed quizzes and exams can not be made up for any reason, including illness. Quizzes can often be taken in advance if prior arrangements are made.</p>
         <br />

         <h4>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h4>
         <p>Collaboration on homework is allowed. Quizzes and exams are individual work. Anyone collaborating on quizzes or exams will get an F in the course and be reported to Academic Affairs. See the campus statement on Academic Dishonesty: Cheating and Plagiarism (<a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/~acadsen/Cheating&amp;Plagiarism.html">C.A.M. 684</a>)</p>
         <br />

         <h4>COMMUNICATIONS</h4>
         <p>Occasionally the instructor will mail announcements to the entire class by using an alias which sends mail to your Cal Poly email account. If you don't use this account regularly, you should setup your Cal Poly email account to forward your mail to your regular email account. Communications to the instructor via email are accepted and encouraged. However, questions about course material are often difficult to answer via email and may require a face-to-face meeting. </p>
         <br />

         <h4>CLASSROOM CLIMATE</h4>
         <p>Questions and discussions are strongly encouraged in this course, even if they interrupt lecture. If, at any time during lecture, you have a question about the material being discussed, raise your hand and ask. In addition, an atmosphere conducive to learning can be fostered by minimizing distractions for others who are trying to concentrate. Common courtesies include:
            <ul type="disc">
               <li>Pet Peeve: DO NOT leave class early without previously telling me that you must leave early. If you must leave without prior notice, excuse yourself politely.</li>
               <li>Arrive on time. If you arrive late please enter quietly and take a seat in the row nearest the door. </li>
               <li>Don't use cell phones or pagers in the classroom or lab; turn off any audible alarms. </li>
            </ul>
         </p>
