      <span style="font-weight: bold;">CPE 102 Lab 4 - Interfaces,
      polymorphism, compile-time vs. run-time behavior, and run-time binding</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Goals:</span><br>
      <ul>
         <li>To gain a better understanding of compile-time versus run-time
            issues in Java.
         </li>
         <li>To gain a better understanding of run-time binding in Java.<br>
         </li>
         <li>To gain a better understanding of interfaces and polymorphism<br>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orientation:</span><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 26px;">You are going to read about some code
         that is fully described but not fully shown and determine if various
         code fragments would result in a compiler error, a run-time error
         (sometimes), or always compile and run correctly. Ideally, you will
         attempt to determine the correct answer simply by looking at the giving
         code then, after answering the questions you will implement the
         specified interfaces, classes, and develop tests for each of the
         fragments to determine the correct answer.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 26px;">You are encouraged to use the specified
         code as a platform to explore more code fragments of your own design to
         increase your awareness of the issues and concepts explored by this lab.<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What to Do:</span><br>
      <ol>
         <li>Read, carefully, this <a href="lab04_worksheet.pdf">handout</a> (you don't actually need to print it)</li>
         <li>
            <p>After filling out (or just writing down) the table in the <a href="lab04_worksheet.pdf">handout</a>
               with your best answers:
            </p>
         </li>
         <ol>
            <li>Write interfaces and classes that meet the descriptions found
               in the <a href="lab04_worksheet.pdf">handout</a> (<span style="font-weight: bold;">A, B, C, D, </span>and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> E</span>). Be sure to include any
               specified methods in the correct interface or class.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>In a file called <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Tests.java</span>,
                  write tests for each code fragment to see if you answers were correct.
               </p>
            </li>
            <ol>
               <li>Remember: You must determine how many different types of
                  object references can be assigned to each reference type. When a
                  reference can be assigned more that one type of object you will have to
                  develop multiple tests for any code fragment that uses that reference
                  to see if it compiles, always works, or only sometimes works.
                  For example in the second row in the table, variable <strong>a</strong> could be referencing an object of type <strong>C</strong> (a = new C()) or <strong>D</strong> (a = new D()).
                  <br>
               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>Remember: Some will not compile. You will have to comment
                     them out to continue your testing.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Remember:
                     Some will compile but fail at run-time. You will have to comment out
                     the ones that fail at run-time to continue your testing.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>Remember: Some will always compile and run without error.<br>
               </li>
            </ol>
         </ol>
      </ol>
