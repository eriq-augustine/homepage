      Orientation and Sample Code</span><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 22px; width: 1133px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit testing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a>
         are widely used techniques to help ensure code quality. They can be
         especially helpful to beginning programmers because their use
         encourages and facilitates incremental development. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model">Incremental development</a>
         helps you learn-as-you-go and can minimize confusion, bugs, and the
         amount of code that needs to be rewritten. While these techniques may
         not save time, they have been shown to improve code quality
         when employed by experienced professionals. It is my belief, when used

         102P1a-85 (by 9:00pm Thursday 10/2/2014 for 85% credit)<br>

         correctly, their use will save most beginning programmers much time and
         frustration, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the process of
         software development.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 22px; width: 1133px;">There are many unit
         testing frameworks already in existence. They tend to be rich,
         complicated environments that can easily overwhelm beginning
         programmers and distract attention away from the more fundamental
         skills that need to be mastered first. This assignment attempts to
         solve that conundrum by having you write a small, but useful, subset of
         unit testing functions. By writing them yourself you will have a deeper
         understanding of what they are doing and how they work. Also, because
         they are relatively simple, they are serve as excellent place to start
         learning Object Oriented Programming techniques! This assignment is modeled after a small subset of methods found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUnit">JUnit</a> framework.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 22px; width: 1133px;">Unit testing is not really
         an "object oriented" problem but, since this class is an OOP class and
         we are using Java, we'll have to make it fit. Normally I'd would avoid
         problems using the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">static</span> key word as long as possible but, due to the nature of the problem, we are going to dive in head first!
         In Java methods (a.k.a. functions) can be static. The nice thing about
         static methods is they can be called without having to construct an
         object. The only restriction on static
         methods is that can only use static data and local variables (not instance variables). This is
         not a problem for us since we don't need any other type of data for our
         unit testing methods. When writing static methods you simply include
         the static keyword in the method declaration as follows:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 22px; width: 1133px;"><small><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class SUnit</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
         <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</span><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Class variables here - syntax shown below.<br>
         </span></small>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 22px; width: 1133px;"><small><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void assertEquals(long expect, long actual)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Stuff not shown...<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
         <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</span></small>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 22px; width: 1133px;"><br>
         The SUnit class will keep track of how many tests have been run and how
         many of them detected errors. This means it will need some variables
         that live for the life of the program and not just during a single
         method call. This means local variables will not sufficient. Normally
         we would declare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">instance</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">variables</span></a>
         (variables declared in a class and outside of a method. However, static
         methods can't access instance variables because no instance (object)
         was created and, therefore, they don't exist! The solution is to
         declare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_variable"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">class variables</span></a>. A <span style="font-style: italic;">class variable</span>
         belongs to the class and is shared by all instances of the class and it
         exists for the life of the program. It is very much like a global
         variable in C (if you know what that is). Fortunately, class variables
         can be accessed by static methods - perfect for out needs. Class
         variables are declared in a class and outside of a method and include
         the static keyword in the declaration. Here is an example of how you
         would declare a class variable in SUnit:<br>
      </p>
      <small><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; public class SUnit</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
      <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</span><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private static int testCount;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Methods here...</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
      <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</span></small><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 22px; width: 1133px;"><br>
         Calling static methods is straightforward in Java. Since a static method belongs to the class you simple call it as follows:
      </p>
      <small><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUnit.assertEquals(x, y);</span></small><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 22px; width: 1133px;"><br>
         Finally, you will be making use of the Java Standard Library's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html">Throwable</a> class, specifically it's <span style="font-style: italic;">printStackTrace</span>
         method when reporting errors. To use the method you must first
         construct a Throwable object and then call it on the object instance
         you just created.&nbsp; The Throwable class has a constructor that
         accepts a message - this is how you will provide the exact message
         specified later in this assignment. Here is an example of how you could
         construct a Throwable object and call the printStackTrace method:
      </p>
      <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throwable throwable = new Throwable("Your error message here");<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throwable.printStackTrace();</small><br>
      </span><br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Suggestions</span><br>
      <ol>
         <li>Start early, read the entire assignment, and ask your

         <li>
            <p>Develop
               incrementally, one method at a time, testing as you go.&nbsp; The
               methods are very similar so developing and testing one well and then
               using it as a model for the others will be both more efficient and more
               pleasant.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>

      Testing With the Provided Test Driver<br>
      </span>
      <ol>
         <li>You should develop and use your own tests prior to using
            the provided test driver.
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Do not use the provided test driver (provided on the first due
