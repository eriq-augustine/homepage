            collaboration is allowed on this program assignment. Your program must

            <li>You will be modifying your <a href="../03/program-03.html">Program 3</a>
               implementation to take
               advantage of your new-found skills with Java inheritance.&nbsp;
               Now that you know about inheritance you realize there is a different
               and, perhaps, even better way
               to
               implement your solution to <a href="../03/program-03.html">Program 3</a>.&nbsp;
               Much of the code and
               instance
               variables defined in the various classes that implement the Shape
               interface
               turned out to be identical.&nbsp; You now realize that using
               inheritance would
               allow you to avoid duplicating this code and data so you decide to
               rewrite Shape as an abstract class and move all common data and methods
               to this new class.
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>You notice that rectangles and triangles are
                  both special kinds of convex polygons and that, using inheritance, you
                  can support the Rectangle and Triangle classes by making them each a
                  subclass of ConvexPolygon. This will result in the Rectangle and
                  Triangle classes having no instance variables and much of their logic
                  moving the the ConvexPolygon class! While this does require some
                  thought and effort it&nbsp;will result in more easily maintained
                  code.&nbsp;
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p> You decide that you would like to have a Square class. With
                  inheritance this should be relatively easy since,
                  geometrically speaking, squares are a special type of rectangle. You
                  decide to make the new Square class a subclass of
                  Rectangle and, because a square is a rectangle, no instance variables
                  are
                  required in the Square class since the Rectangle class has all of the
                  necessary data elements to
                  represent a square. However, there is the little problem of what to do
                  with the inherited setHeight and setWidth methods from
                  the Rectangle class - you don't want a Square object that isn't square!
                  In addition, you will have to handle the setVertex method inherited
                  from Rectangle (and, indirectly, ConvexPolygon).<br>
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>You decide that you would like to have an
               Ellipse class. With inheritance this should be relatively easy since,
               geometrically speaking, circles are a special type of ellipse. You
               decide to make the new Ellipse class the super-class of Circle and,
               because a
               circle is an ellipse, no instance variables are
               required in the Circle class since the Ellipse class will have all the
               necessary data elements to represent a circle. However, there is the
               little problem of what to do
               with the setSemiMajorAxis and setSemiMinorAxis the Circle class
               inherits from
               the Ellipse class - you don't want a Circle object that isn't a circle!
            </li>
            <li>
               <p> As a new feature, you decide you want to be able to order
                  shapes, i.e., determine if one shape is less than, equal to, or greater
                  than another shape. You will base order to two criteria, first on the
                  shapes name and, second, on its area. The Java Standard Library has an
                  interface called Comparable that you will implement to solve this
                  requirement. Know that the String class also implements the Comparable
                  interface so it will be easy to compare the shape names.

               <p>Fianlly, you realize your <a href="../03/program-03.html">Program 3</a>
                  solution was vulnerable
                  to having some of its instance variable data modfied by code outside
                  the classes even though your instance variables were all private. This
                  is because some of the instance variables are references to mutable
                  objects and means anyone that has
                  a reference to the same data as your private instance variables is able
                  to modify the object your private reference points to. This is known as

                  to inheritance and depending on how you wrote them, you may need to
                  modify some of the existing methods so that they work correctly. For
                  example, the method getRectangles is supposed to return all Rectangle
                  objects. Now, however, Square objects exist and they have an isA
                  relationship with the Rectangle class. You must now filter out Squares
                  in that method. Other methods have similar issues. You can use the <span style="font-style: italic;">instanceof</span> operator with some
                  additional logic or you can call <span style="font-style: italic;">getClass()
                  </span>to find out exactly what something is. There is a convienent
                  syntax for obtaining the Class class for any class, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">ClassName.class</span>. You can compare
                  that with the value returned by <span style="font-style: italic;">getClass()</span>
                  to see if the reference points to the specific class type you are
                  curious about.<br>
